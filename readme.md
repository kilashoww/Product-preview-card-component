## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. <br> (whithout the design file source :persevere: but Sooo satisfying when it looks identical :heart_eyes:).

The users should be able to:
  - View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover and focus states for interactive elements
